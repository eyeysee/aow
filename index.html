The information it contains is useful for every stage in your life, over and over again. The information is useful in order to create long-term strategies, but also to fortify your defenses. The best offense is a good defense. This book will clue you into what’s out there waiting for you. People are sneaky and malicious. Sun Tzu discusses almost every shitty situation you will encounter. Consider Sun Tzu your mensch, your therapist, your life advisor. How cool is that?.<br>
